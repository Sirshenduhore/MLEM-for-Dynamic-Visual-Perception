#MLEM for Dynamic Visual Perception:

Introduction

Facial expression-based emotion detection applications are increasingly utilized in decision-analysis processes, particularly in diagnosing mental health conditions. Despite previous efforts in assessing the mental health of college students, there remains a gap in employing dynamic Facial Expression Recognition (D-FER) techniques. This work proposes an Organized-Integrate-Voting (OIV) model inspired by class-consciousness to understand the mental health of engineering students at a college in India. The model integrates four deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) classifiers based on transfer learning, each achieving accuracy rates exceeding 95% in recognizing emotions from dynamic visual perceptions.
